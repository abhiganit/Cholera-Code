function [XUr,RSSr,beta,tau,DB,DA,DAE,K,n,rl,rh,CF,RIF,RF] = BackwardsSelection(XU,RSS,k)
%BACKWARDSSELECTION Takes the comblex model XU and determines if a simplier
%model is more suitble
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% XU -  the X input that will be used in the fitting process. Will be zeros
 % or one (1 x 11)
    % XU(1)- beta_0
    % XU(2) - population density
    % XU(3) - number of health facilities 
    % XU(4) - Past incidence
    % XU(5) - Product of incidence and attacks
    % XU(6) - Product of incidence and conflict
    % XU(7) - Product of incidence and rainfall
    % XU(8) - Rainfall only        
    % XU(9) - Incidence in other govnorates
    % XU(10) - Attacks only
    % XU(11) - Rebel control
% RSS - residual sum of squares of the model
% k - the number of paramters in the complex model
